# mediapipe-robot-arm-controller
A demonstration of using MediaPipe Holistic to create a controller for a robot arm. 

# Installation

I would recommend creating a Python virtual environment first:
```
$ python3 -m venv mp_env && source mp_env/bin/activate
```
Then, install the requirements.txt as follows:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the Demo

To launch the demo script:
```
$ python demo.py
```

It will use the first web camera available on your machine
